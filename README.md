# Instructions For Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure that Node.js is downloaded/in use on your machine (simply running `node -v` from the CLI will delineate this fact). If it is not, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and select the proper "LTS" version of Node for download with respect to your OS and 32/64-bit options
3. Make sure you are in the root of the cloned repository, and run `npm i`, `yarn install`, or whatever the appropriate dependency manager you currently utilize. Default to `npm i` if you have just installed Node.js
4. In the command line, from the root of the application, run `node jbrunt.js` to execute the program. This may take several seconds, depending on various factors
5. Error messaging will occur if an error is encountered
6. A success message should appear after running the app
7. The JSON output will appear in the root as `update.json`
